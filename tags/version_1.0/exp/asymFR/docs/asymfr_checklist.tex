In this study, the participant will be presented a list of words one
word at a time.  After the items on the list, the participant will be
asked to perform some simple math true/false math problems by pressing
a key ('N'=true, 'M'=false).  At the end of each list, the participant
will then be asked to recall as many words as they can from the word
list. \\
